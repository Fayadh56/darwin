        <h2>APPLICATION PARTNER TREATMENT OF PERSONAL INFORMATION.</h2>
        toDarwin.com may provide personal information to the applicable Application Partners.

Moreover, if toDarwin.com, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that toDarwin.com goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party.

This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</p>

        <p>With Your Consent: Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your personal information may be shared with third parties, and will be able to prevent the sharing of this information.</p>
